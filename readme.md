# Accelerometer Test Suite

## Introduction

This repo is an investigation into iOS & cross-platform implementation of accelerometer controls in various browsers.

Currently the implementation in `accel-poc-cross-platform` works in Chrome on iOS & Android.

## Next Steps

- Improve accel-poc-cross-platform:
  - Only render permissions button when required (ie. in iOS)
  - Position `block` better (currently off-center)
- Test in Fiefox, Edge and Safari. resolve any issues. Safari may not permit accelerometer use; check this.
